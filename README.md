# terrabuddy

Terrabuddy is a templating engine built on top of [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html) and [terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/).  Terragrunt allows terraform to be used in a way that is [more DRY, more auditable, and more modular.](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/keep-your-terraform-code-dry/).  Terrabuddy goes the last kilometer by adding templating, variables, auto complete, and commands to set up your environment more quickly.

Terrabuddy can be used in conjunction with a terragrunt installation.  Alternatively, terragrunt code can be ported to terrabuddy simply by renaming your .hcl files to .htlt

### Features
- easily install and update terraform and terrabuddy
- easily manage terragrunt component interdependencies via bundles 
- easily inject variables into your terragrunt modules
- built in git workflow support


# Installation

### System Requirements

- Linux only (for now)
- python3 with pip3 in your $PATH

```
git clone https://github.com/weatherforce/terrabuddy.git
cd terrabuddy/tb
make install             # installs the tb CLI tool with python requirements

tb --setup               # downloads and installs terraform and terragrunt
tb --setup-terraformrc   # (optional) installs useful terraform default settings
tb --setup-shell         # (optional) installs useful tb shell aliases
```

### Installing terraform modules

terrabuddy requires terraform modules.  Weatherforce provides a repo with modules for Azure, which can be cloned here:

`git clone https://github.com/weatherforce/terraform-modules-azure.git`

Keep a note of the path into which the above is cloned, this will be used by terrabuddy via the TF_MODULES_ROOT env var


# Background

`tb` is the terrabuddy command line interface.  It facilitates setting up your machine (see installation), allows you to list components and run terraform commands such as **plan**, **apply**, **destroy** and manages shared variables. 

tb introduces three notions for managig resourecs: **projects**, **components** and **bundles**.  A project is a git repo with a specific purpose.  Components are individual objects that you create on your cloud provider.  Bundles are sets of components that depend upon one another (and tb knows how to create them in the correct order).

## Anatomy of a project:

```
prep/
prod/
sbx/
.envrc.tpl
.gitignore
project.yml
README.md
remote_state.hclt
```

- Azure contains three environments, `sbx` (sandbox), `prep` (pre-prod), and  `prod`.  These are the top level directories in the project
- .envrc.tpl contains a template for required environment variables, notably TF_MODULES_ROOT which points to the repo where terraform-modules-azure has been cloned
- project.yml contains project-specific variables.  Other .yml files within the project contain 
- remote_state.hclt is an hcl template that will be applied in all components

## Anatomy of a component:

Components contain hclt files, e.g. hcl templates.  [HCL](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/syntax.html) is a json-like declarative language used by terraform.

```
inputs.hclt
terragrunt.hclt
```

- inputs.hcl contains the inputs which will be injected into the terraform module
- terragrunt.hclt tells terragrunt which terraform module to use with this component
- hclt files contain variables, formatted **${like_this}**

### Component parsing and variables

When `tb` is run on a component, it:

1. searches in the component directory and all parent directories for hclt files and combines them into a single hclt file. 
1. lints/parses all hclt files, fails if there are syntax errors
1. loads all yml files in the component and all parent directories as variables. 
1. replaces all variables in the hclt.  If variables are left unreplaced, the parser stops with an error message.
1. if all variables are replaced, it saves the result as `terragrunt.hcl` in the component directory.  This file is ready to be used by terragrunt


**Component parsing in detail**

combines hclt files in the component directory with those in its parent directories.  For example, at the root of the project there is a remote_state.hclt file.  The contents of this file will be included in **all components**.

Another example is to refactor the terragrunt.hclt in a situation where a folder contains lots of components that use the same terraform module.

```
az-wf-platform-infra$ ll prep/network_security_groups/*
prep/network_security_groups/bastion:
inputs.hclt
terragrunt.hclt

prep/network_security_groups/db:
inputs.hclt
terragrunt.hclt

prep/network_security_groups/db-apps:
inputs.hclt
terragrunt.hclt

prep/network_security_groups/public-webserver:
inputs.hclt
terragrunt.hclt
```

All of the above terragrunt.hclt files are exactly the same.  

```
az-wf-platform-infra$ ll prep/network_security_groups/*
prep/network_security_groups/bastion:
inputs.hclt
terragrunt.hclt

prep/network_security_groups/db:
inputs.hclt
terragrunt.hclt

prep/network_security_groups/db-apps:
inputs.hclt
terragrunt.hclt

prep/network_security_groups/public-webserver:
inputs.hclt
terragrunt.hclt
```

We can move them up one level in the filesystem, thusly:

```
az-wf-platform-infra$ ll prep/network_security_groups/*

prep/network_security_groups:
terragrunt.hclt

prep/network_security_groups/bastion:
inputs.hclt

prep/network_security_groups/db:
inputs.hclt

prep/network_security_groups/db-apps:
inputs.hclt

prep/network_security_groups/public-webserver:
inputs.hclt
```

**Template Overriding**

hclt files with the same filename as others above them in the filesystem override them.  For example, if you have a component that requires a specific remote_state configuration, you can override the one in the root folder, thusly:

```
prep/network_security_groups/public-webserver-other-remote-state:
inputs.hclt
remote_state.hclt  # overrides remote_state.hclt in project root
terragrunt.hclt
```

**Component variables in detail**

tb loads variables in a cascade process, starting at the project root and moving down the filesystem to the component.  For example if we examine the component `prep/bastion/managed_disk`, the following yml files are loaded:

1. **project.yml** in the project root, contains various key/value pairs
1. **prep/env.yml** \
`env: "prep"`
1. **prep/bastion/appname.yml** \
`appname: "bastion"`

If, for example, **project.yml** contains `appname`, its value will be overridden by **prep/bastion/appname.yml**.

You can use tb to display component variables with the `showvars` command

```
$ tb showvars prep/bastion/managed_disk

COMPONENT_DIRNAME=managed_disk
COMPONENT_PATH=prep/bastion/managed_disk
PROJECT_ROOT=/home/user/myprojects/az-wf-platform-infra
TB_INSTALL_PATH=/home/user/wf/terrabuddy/tb
appname=bastion
env=prep
location=westeurope
organization=wforg
private_subnet_cidr=172.16.4.0/22
project_name=wf-platform-infra
public_subnet_cidr=172.16.2.0/24
vnet_cidr=172.16.0.0/19

```

**Special Variables**

In addition to variables loaded in .yml files, tb also provides special component variables

- `COMPONENT_DIRNAME` the directory that contains the component
- `COMPONENT_PATH` path to component, relative to project
- `PROJECT_ROOT` absolute path to project


## Bundles

Anywhere in a project, components can be bound together as a bundle, simply by placing a bundle.yml file with an `order` object.

For example, `prep/bastion/bundle.yml`

```
order:
    - network_interface
    - a_record
    - managed_disk
    - virtual_machine
```

The above bundle tells tb that when the user runs `tb <command> prep/bastion` it will in fact run four components: `prep/bastion/network_interface`, `prep/bastion/a_record`, etc... in the specified order.  When running the destroy command, this order is reversed.

You can use the `--dry` argument on a bundle to see its components:

```
$ tb show prep/bastion --dry

tb show prep/bastion/network_interface
tb show prep/bastion/a_record
tb show prep/bastion/managed_disk
tb show prep/bastion/virtual_machine
```

Bundles also support wildcards and other bundles, for example `prep/bundle.yml`

```
order:
    - resource_group
    - dns/zone/*                    # all components in this dir, alphabetical order
    - virtual_network
    - subnets/*                     # all components in this dir, alphabetical order
    - application_security_groups/* # all components in this dir, alphabetical order
    - network_security_groups/*     # all components in this dir, alphabetical order
    - bastion                       # this is another bundle
```

`tb <command> prep` is thus a single "monster" bundle that runs the entire prep environment


## Listing Components and bundles

tb uses the same commands as terraform: [plan, apply, destroy, refresh, etc](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/index.html).
Components in a project can be listed with the `tb plan|apply|show` command.

```
$ pwd
~/az-wf-platform-infra
```

```
$ tb plan
OOPS, no component specified, try one of these (bundles are bold underlined):

tb plan sbx
tb plan sbx/application_security_groups/db-apps
tb plan sbx/application_security_groups/public-webserver
tb plan sbx/application_security_groups/manager
tb plan sbx/application_security_groups/db
tb plan sbx/application_security_groups/bastion
tb plan sbx/virtual_network
tb plan sbx/storage_account/std
tb plan sbx/storage_account/premium
tb plan sbx/dns/zone/sbx.weatherforce.net
tb plan sbx/dns/zone/sbx.prv
tb plan prod/keybaseca
tb plan prod/keybaseca/network_interface
tb plan prod/keybaseca/managed_disk
tb plan prod/keybaseca/virtual_machine
tb plan prod/keybaseca/a_record
tb plan prod/application_security_groups/db-apps
tb plan prod/application_security_groups/public-webserver
tb plan prod/application_security_groups/db
tb plan prod/bastion
tb plan prod/bastion/network_interface
tb plan prod/bastion/virtual_machine
tb plan prod/bastion/a_record
tb plan prod/resource_group
tb plan prod/network_security_groups/db-apps
tb plan prod/network_security_groups/public-webserver
tb plan prod/network_security_groups/db
...

```

## running `tb` commands

Each of the above lines is a component.  Running `tb plan <component>` will run the plan command on the component in question.

```
$ tb plan prep/application_security_groups/db-apps
```

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

No changes. Infrastructure is up-to-date.
```

The above result means that the component already exists in Azure and is up to date with the component.

## Git workflow integration

`tb` was designed to take git workflow considerations into account.  When working with terrabuddy components, special care must be taken so ensure that developers working on separate components do not clobber each other's work.  tb includes git checking functions to inform developers if their local git repository is behind remote changes.

For instance, developers A and B work on two unrelated components.

1. Developer A is working on an application VM in `prep/testappA/virtual_machine`.  Developer A sees that network security rules do not allow their application to access required resources.  They amend the security group `prep/network_security_groups/db-apps` to add the required security rules.  They apply their changes and push to remote.
1. Developer B is working on an unrelated component.  They too need to amend `prep/network_security_groups/db-apps` to add their own required security rules (different from those that Developer A added).  They have forgotten to `git pull` so the changes made by Developer A are not on their machine.  **If they run `tb apply prep/network_security_groups/db-apps` they will clobber developer A's changes.**  
1. **However** tb does a git fetch and compares branches **before** each command.
1. Since Developer A has pushed their changes, tb on Developer B'a machine will show this message:
`GIT ERROR: You are on branch master and are behind the remote.  Please git pull and/or merge before proceeding.  Below is a git status:...`

The above also works for feature branches.  If developer B is working on a feature branch that was made prior to developer A's changes (pushed to master branch), tb will detect that Developer B's FB is behind master and prompt them to merge before proceeding.
